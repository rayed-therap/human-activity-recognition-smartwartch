# Human activity recognition (HAR) using smartwatch data

## Dataset
The dataset is the [1] [WISDM Smartphone and Smartwatch Activity and Biometrics Dataset Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/WISDM+Smartphone+and+Smartwatch+Activity+and+Biometrics+Dataset+) which contains accelerometer and gyroscope time-series sensor data collected from a smartphone and smartwatch as 51 test subjects perform 18 activities for 3 minutes each. **Only smartwatch readings are used in this project.** Here is a glimpse of the data:
